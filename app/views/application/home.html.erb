The Hikers App is a place for hikers to find trailheads and hikes, as well as share their own hikes. Users can also check-in at trailheads, leave trip reports on hikes, and view other users' check-ins and trip reports. This allows users to learn more about how busy a given trailhead is, and the current conditions on various trails.
</p>
<p>
The Hikers App is a Rails web application created by Leonor Colbert as a portfolio project in association with Flatiron School's Online Software Engineering Program.
