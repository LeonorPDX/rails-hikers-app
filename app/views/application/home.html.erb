The Hikers App is a place for hikers to find trailheads and hikes, as well as share their own hikes. Users can also check-in at trailheads and leave trip reports on hikes, letting other users know how popular a trailhead is and the current conditions on a particular hike.
</p>
<p>
The Hikers App is a Rails web application created by Leonor Colbert as a portfolio project in association with Flatiron School's Online Software Engineering Program.
