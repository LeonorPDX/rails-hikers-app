# Welcome to the Hikers App

The Hikers App is a place for hikers to find trailheads and hikes, as well as share their own hikes. Users can also check-in at trailheads, leave trip reports on hikes, and view other users' check-ins and trip reports. This allows users to learn more about how busy a given trailhead is, and the current conditions on various trails.

This app was developed as a portfolio project for Flatiron School's Online Software Engineering Program. The user registrations and sessions was created with Devise, third-party provider registrations with Omniauth, and CSS styling with Bulma.
